# Surveillance-Robot
This engineering project focuses on creating a surveillance robot with IR remote control and basic autonomous navigation. Using an ARM M4F microcontroller, it incorporates PIR, ultrasonic, and IR sensors for motion detection, obstacle avoidance, and command processing. A DRV8833 motor driver powers the robot's movement, supported by a safe 4xAA NiMH battery system.
